## DevOps

# Application Framework

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is an open-source micro framework maintained by Pivotal, which was acquired by VMware in 2019. It provides Java developers with a platform to get started with an auto configurable production-grade Spring application.

[Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed applications, or frameworks. It can run Hadoop, Jenkins, Spark, Aurora, and other frameworks on a dynamically shared pool of nodes.

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing.

[Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

# Runtime Platform

[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/?nav=min) is a set of services for teams to share code, track work, and ship software; CLIs Build, deploy, diagnose, and manage multi-platform, scalable apps and services; Azure Pipelines Continuously build, test, and deploy to any platform and cloud; Azure Lab Services Set up labs for classrooms, trials, development and testing, and other scenarios.

[Azure Draft](https://draft.sh/) is a tool for developers to create cloud-native applications on Kubernetes. 

# Infrastructure Automatation

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation.

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is an open-source build-automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the project configuration.

[Chef](https://www.chef.io/) is an effortless Infrastructure Suite offers visibility into security and compliance status across all infrastructure and makes it easy to detect and correct issues long before they reach production.

[Puppet](https://puppet.com/) is an open source tool that makes continuous integration and delivery of your software on traditional or containerized infrastructure easy by pulling together all your existing tools and giving you flexibility to deploy your way. 

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

[Salt](https://www.saltstack.com/) is Python-based, open-source software for event-driven IT automation, remote task execution, and configuration management. Supporting the "Infrastructure as Code" approach to data center system and network deployment and management, configuration automation, SecOps orchestration, vulnerability remediation, and hybrid cloud control. 

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp.It enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

# Cloud Infrastructure

[Amazon web service(AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) is a platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions. The AWS platform is developed with a combination of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) integrates industry-leading tools(data management, hybrid & multi-cloud, and AI & ML) with Cloud Storage for enhanced support with everything from security and data transfer, to data backup and archive. Expand all . Backup, archival, and disaster recovery. Along with File systems and gateways.

[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) is a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, managed through a dashboard or via the OpenStack API. OpenStack works with popular enterprise and open source technologies making it ideal for heterogeneous infrastructure.

[Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) is an open source, multi cloud application platform as a service that makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy and scale applications, providing a choice of clouds, developer frameworks, and application services. It is an open source project and is available through a variety of private cloud distributions and public cloud instances.
