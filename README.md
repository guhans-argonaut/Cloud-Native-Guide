[Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

## Runtime Platform

[BOSH](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/) is a tool that prepares your infrastructure for what needs to be managed. BOSH espouses software engineering best practices, such as continuous delivery, by making it easy to create software releases that automatically update complex distributed systems with simple commands.Due to the flexibility and power of BOSH, Google and VMware made it the heart of the Kubo project, now called the Cloud Foundry Container Runtime, based on Kubernetes.
